                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Why is recycling important? What are the benefits of recycling?We’ve all heard of the&nbsp;<em>Three Rs: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</em>.&nbsp;As a slogan, it’s about perfect—it is short, can’t be misunderstood, and has the pleasant ring of alliteration.&nbsp;&nbsp;To&nbsp;<strong>reduce</strong>&nbsp;is to cut down on what is produced and what we consume.To&nbsp;<strong>reuse</strong>&nbsp;is to find ways to repurpose&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">items which otherwise are designed to be discarded.To&nbsp;<strong>recycle</strong>&nbsp;is to submit items to be broken down into base materials and converted into future products.Though this catchy phrase makes an easy-to-live-by rule, it only makes us question further. So, in this guide, we’ll look at ways recycling helps the environment. Shortly after, we’ll discuss common materials you can separate and recycle, as well as why those materials are important to recycle.</p>
                        <h2><strong>Here are a few ways recycling helps the environment and fight climate change:</strong></h2>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;1. Recycling Conserves Resources</strong><br>When we recycle plastic, we reduce the need for more plastic to be manufactured. By recycling paper, we do our part to lessen deforestation and save trees from being cut down.&nbsp;Separating cans and other metals helps to cut down on damaging mining and our growing need for raw materials.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Recycling Saves Energy</strong><br>It takes much more energy to create industrial-grade materials from scratch than it does just to reform old materials and reuse them. For example, it is&nbsp;estimated&nbsp;that “recycling aluminum saves 90% to 95% of the energy needed to make aluminum from bauxite ore.” Recycling saves energy because recycled materials don’t require factories to expend so much greenhouse gas emissions than they would if they had created the same item again from scratch using raw materials.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Recycling Protects the Environment</strong><br>When we cut down on the amount of new materials and natural resources we need to extract from the earth, whether through farming, mining, logging, etc., we protect vulnerable ecosystems and wildlife from harm or eradication and allow them to exist for generations to come. Recycling materials emits way less greenhouse gases into the environment than primary production.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. Recycling Slows the Spread of Landfills</strong><br>In the United States alone, there are&nbsp;2,000 active landfills&nbsp;all full of solid waste and emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as it all slowly decomposes. This doesn’t account for the many that have been closed due to reaching capacity, or the future landfills that’ll have to be created when the active landfills become land<em>full</em>.</p>
                        <p><strong>5. Recycling Creates Jobs</strong><br>That’s right: believe it or not, one of the benefits of recycling is that it actually helps create jobs! A&nbsp;study&nbsp;by Friends of the Earth determined that reaching a 70% home recycle rate would create 51,400 jobs in the United Kingdom alone. In the US, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)&nbsp;found&nbsp;that reaching a 75% recycling rate nationwide would create 1.5 million new jobs</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6. Recycling Supports the SDGs</strong><br>Our future and the future of all generations after us depend on sustainable production and consumption. As such, recycling is one of the best ways to support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.&nbsp;</p>
